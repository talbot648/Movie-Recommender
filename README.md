# My Personal Project

## Movie Recommender
This is a personal project of mine looking to combine my data engineering skills learned along with practicing my software development skills again. This web application aims to allow users to select the films that they most enjoy and then recommend similar films they might like based on a variety of factors. 

## MVP
- online web application
- allow a user to select a film they like
- recommend similar films based on either cast, genre and other data about the film.


## as project develops
- Allow for multiple users with their own selection of favourite films and recommendations
- Logins for different users
- store user data in databse tables
- use the data to identify correlations/ popularity
- analyse the data using powerBi
